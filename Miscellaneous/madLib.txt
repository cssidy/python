Just waking up in the morning gotta thank PRONOUN
I don't know but today seems kinda ADJECTIVE
No barking from the dogs, no smog
And momma VERB a NOUN with no NOUN
I got my grub on, but didn't NOUN out
ADJECTIVE got a call from a girl want to VERB
Hooked it up on later as I hit the NOUN
Thinking will I live another twenty NOUN
I gotta go cause I got me a drop top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the NOUN VERB
Had to stop at a red NOUN
Looking in my mirror not a  NOUN in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from PRONOUN and she can VERB all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all
Which park, are y'all playin' basketball?
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week VERB around and got a NOUN
Freaking brothers every way like PRONOUN.
I can't believe, today was a good day.
