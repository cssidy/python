Many of the exercises here are also seen in the book, "Automate The Boring Stuff With Python" by Al Sweigart. https://automatetheboringstuff.com/.

Other exercises can be found over at https://projecteuler.net/.


## convertFahrenheitToCelsius.py

Converts a given number to celsius.

## decimalConversionTricks.py

This program is based on a technical skills test that I had to take for a job application. The program asks the user to enter any number, then converts that number to its binary equivalent, inverts that new number (010 becomes 101), then converts that new number back to decimal and prints the results.

## collatzSequence.py

This program explores the Collatz Sequence. Enter any number, and you'll magically end at 1.

## heartGrid.py

Prints a heart image made of .'s and 0's.

## joinList.py

This program takes a list value as an argument and returns a string with all the items separated by a comma and a space, with "and" inserted before the last item.

## strongPasswordDetection.py

Uses regex to determine if a given input has at least eight characters, contains both uppercase and lowercase characters and contains at least one digit and special character.
  
## regexVersionOfStrip.py

Use only regex to replicate the effects of strip(). Remove white spaces automatically, and any other character specified in the argument.

## rightAlignTablePrinter.py

Takes a list of strings and displays it in a well-organized table with each column right-justified.

## madLibs.py

Asks for input to replace words in a string. Uses lyrics from Ice Cube's song 'It Was A Good Day'.

## tamagotchi.py
   
Simulates the popular 90's toy made in Japan, the Tamagotchi. Player must feed, play, and maintain the health and mood of a fictional creature. This rendition uses a simple command line GUI. I have also added a new feature, eggs, which extraordinarily happy tamagotchi may lay, and death probabilities for extraordinarily sick/depressed tamagotchi.

## emailCollector.py

Scrapes a web page using the Beautiful Soup library for email addresses and saves them in a text file, then sends emails to all addresses it found.
